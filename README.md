# HYPOTHESIS TESTING 

## Deliverables
->A Report on Hypothesis testing. 
->A Github repository containing your notebook

### a) Specifying the Data Analytic Question
Given two randomly chosen Postal Codes, is the average number of Bluecars taken during weekdays different in the two Postal Codes?

Null Hypothesis(Ho): μ(taken weekday|Postal_Code1) = μ(taken weekday|Postal_Code2)

Alternate Hypothesis(Ha): μ(taken weekday|Postal_Code1) ≠ μ(taken weekday|Postal_Code2)

where μ is the mean number of cars taken during weekdays, Postal_Code1 and Postal_Code2 are the two randomly chosen postcodes from the dataset

### b) Defining the Metric for Success
The metric of succes is either accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis
